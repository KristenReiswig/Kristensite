Buddy is the sweetest and sassiest kitty ever. He's 14 years old and has long white and black fur. He loves eating all the time, sleeping on his cat stand, cleaning himself, and having adventures outside. He loves boxes and won't let us throw out any of them. He also loves holidays when all the family comes to see him, and he can get extra food. For Christmas, he loves playing in the wrapping paper from presents.
